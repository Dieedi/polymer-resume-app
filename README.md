## Work in progress, I've just discover Polymer few days ago.

If you want to test, no online version, yet.

Use " bower install Polymer/polymer#^0.5.5 "

Gruntfile contains "connect" to launch a virtual server on localhost:3000

# polymer-resume-app

First try with Google Polymer

Actual Polymer version 0.8

This project yet use Polymer 0.5.5

Work in progress to switch to 0.8 after completed.
